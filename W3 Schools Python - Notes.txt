Characteristics of Python
Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −
•	It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
•	It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
•	It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
•	It supports automatic garbage collection.
•	It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
Applications of Python
•	Python is a general purpose programming language known for its readability. It is widely applied in various fields.
•	In Data Science, Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used for data analysis and visualization.
•	Python frameworks like Django, and Pyramid, make the development and deployment of Web Applications easy.
•	This programming language also extends its applications to computer vision and image processing.
•	It is also favored in many tasks like Automation, Job Scheduling, GUI development, etc.

Keywords:
Programming and Concepts
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and code that manipulates that data. Common principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
C
A general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s. Known for its efficiency and close-to-hardware control, it's widely used in system/software development.
C++
An extension of the C programming language that includes object-oriented features. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, often used for system/software development, games, and real-time simulations.

Component and Interface Technologies
COM (Component Object Model)
A Microsoft-developed interface standard for enabling interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in a large range of programming languages.
ActiveX
A Microsoft framework based on COM, used to embed and link software components in web browsers and applications, mainly in Internet Explorer.
CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
A standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) that allows communication between various software written in different languages across different platforms.

Languages and Frameworks
Java
A high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Widely used in enterprise applications, mobile development (Android), and web servers.

Data Science Tools
Data Science
An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
Numpy
A Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and high-level mathematical functions.
Pandas
A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures like DataFrames for handling structured data.
Matplotlib
A Python plotting library used to create static, interactive, and animated visualisations in Python.

Web Frameworks
Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy.
Pyramid
A lightweight, flexible Python web framework that is part of the Pylons Project. It allows developers to scale from small applications to large systems.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development
GUI Development
The process of creating graphical interfaces for software applications, allowing users to interact with programs visually rather than via text commands.
Windows MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class Library)
A set of classes in C++ that encapsulate parts of the Windows API to simplify GUI development for Windows applications.
Macintosh
Refers to Apple's line of computers (now called Macs) and their native GUI development typically involves frameworks like Cocoa and Swift.
Unix
A family of multitasking, multiuser operating systems that includes many variants (Linux, BSD). GUI development on Unix systems often involves libraries like GTK or Qt.
