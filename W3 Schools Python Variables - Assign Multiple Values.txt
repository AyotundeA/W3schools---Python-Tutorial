W3 Schools - Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values
Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
Example
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.
One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
Example
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
Example
Unpack a list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Keywords:
Tuple - A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of values. Once created, its values cannot be changed. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
•	You can access elements with indexing: my_tuple[0] → 1
•	Tuples can contain different data types.
•	You cannot modify (append, remove, etc.) tuple elements after creation.
Unpacking - Unpacking is the process of assigning the individual elements of a tuple (or other iterable) to variables in a single statement.
The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple.
