W3 Schools  - Python Variables
Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example 
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Example
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
You will learn more about data types and casting later in this tutorial.
Single or Double Quotes?
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
Example
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Example
This will create two variables:
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
Keywords:
Data Values - The actual information or content stored in a variable or used in a program. Examples include numbers like 42, text like "hello", or Boolean values like True.
Particular Type - Refers to the specific kind of value or data a variable holds—such as an integer, string, or list. For example, 5 is of the particular type integer.
Data Type - A classification that specifies what kind of data a value or variable can hold. Common data types include:
•	int (integer)
•	float (decimal number)
•	str (string/text)
•	bool (Boolean: True or False)
•	list, dict, etc.
Casting - The process of converting a value from one data type to another.
Type() Function - A built-in Python function that returns the data type of a given value or variable.
Function - A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs (parameters), perform actions, and return a result.
Variable - A named storage location in memory used to hold data. The value stored can change (hence variable).
