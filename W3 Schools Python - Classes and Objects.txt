Python Classes and Objects
Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
Create a Class
To create a class, use the keyword class:
Example
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5
Create Object
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
The __init__() Method
The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() method.
All classes have a method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() method to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
Example
Create a class named Person, use the __init__() method to assign values for name and age:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
Note: The __init__() method is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
The __str__() Method
The __str__() method controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
If the __str__() method is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:
Example
The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
Example
The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
Create Methods
You can create your own methods inside objects. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
Let us create a method in the Person class:
Example
Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:
Example
Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
Modify Object Properties
You can modify properties on objects like this:
Example
Set the age of p1 to 40:
p1.age = 40
Delete Object Properties
You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:
Example
Delete the age property from the p1 object:
del p1.age
Delete Objects
You can delete objects by using the del keyword:
Example
Delete the p1 object:
del p1
The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
Example
class Person:
  pass
Keywords:
Properties - In Python, properties are special kinds of attributes that control access to instance variables. They are typically defined using the built-in property() function or the @property decorator. 
Attributes - Attributes are variables that belong to an object. They store data or state about the object. Attributes are usually defined inside the __init__() method or assigned to the object directly.
Constructor - In Python, the constructor is the __init__() method of a class. It is automatically called when a new object (instance) of the class is created. The constructor is typically used to initialise object attributes with values.
Blueprint - A class in Python is often described as a blueprint for creating objects. This means the class defines the structure (attributes) and behaviour (methods) that its objects will have. Each object created from the class is an instance of that blueprint.
